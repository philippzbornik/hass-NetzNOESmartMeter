## About

This repo contains a custom component for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) for exposing a sensor
providing information about a registered [NetzNÖ Smartmeter](https://www.netz-noe.at/smartmeter).

The integration syncs all consumption data in Home Assistant, which allows a hourly view on consumption data in Home Assistant:

## Acknowledgments

This integration is based on the excellent [Wiener Netze Smartmeter](https://github.com/DarwinsBuddy/WienerNetzeSmartmeter) integration by [DarwinsBuddy](https://github.com/DarwinsBuddy) and contributors. We are grateful for their work which served as the foundation for this Netz NÖ adaptation.
